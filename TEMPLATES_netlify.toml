# Netlify Configuration Template
# 
# Place this file in your Flutter project root as: netlify.toml
# 
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to your new Flutter project root
# 2. Update publish directory if your build output is different
# 3. Commit and push to GitHub
# 4. Connect to Netlify and it will auto-use this config

[build]
  # Command to run during build (optional)
  # If you're committing pre-built files, just use echo
  # If you want Netlify to build, use: flutter pub get && dart run build_runner build && flutter build web --release
  # Note: Netlify doesn't have Flutter installed by default, so we recommend Option 1
  command = "echo 'Static files only - pre-built Flutter web app'"
  
  # Directory containing your built files
